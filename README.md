# marketplace_chat
This repository contains the chat system implementation for the UPRM Marketplace WebApp. The chat system is built using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase (Firestore, Authentication, Cloud Functions) for the backend, enabling real-time messaging between users. We could also use examples of WhatsApp.
